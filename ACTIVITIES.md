August 4-7 2017: Still Hacking Anyway 2017, NL.
This was a huge hackers camp set in the wonderful Dutch scenery of Zeewolde. More than 1000 hacker enthusiasts from around the globe came to the event. From former CIA director to facebook specialists.
We had a lot of fun presenting the CodeKlavier alongside our last project, Code Our Glance, where we play as a duo. A video of the event is available [here] (<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efU7trVAPvA?start=971" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>)
