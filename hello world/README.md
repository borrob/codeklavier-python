# Hello World

This piece allows the piano player to live code in SuperCollider. It was presented at [SHA2017](https://sha2017.org) by @wooloogooloo and @narcode. You can watch their presentation, concert, and performance on [youtube](https://youtu.be/efU7trVAPvA).

## SuperCollider
Perhaps @narcode can say something and explain about the supercollider subdirectory.

## Run
Make sure you installed supercollider and the required libraries before you start hello_world. Then you can start by ``python3 hello_world.py``.

## NKK
The NKK is a small tweak on the normal hello world piece.
