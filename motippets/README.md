# Motippets

The Motippets prototype  processes the pianist’s input of musical motifs and generates the associated code snippets. The system uses a combination of hard-coded motifs to code combinations and a series of conditionals which test various aspects of the pianist's “grammar”. Once completed, Motippets aims to be the proof of concept for the CodeKlavier to be considered an esolang or a music-domain specific programming language.
