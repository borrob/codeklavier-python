"""miditest.py

This file is a tester for the midisignals from your input device. It helps you
to check if your midi input device is being registered and its messages
received. This file is not a formal part of the CodeKlavier. However, if you can
see the midi messages being printed after running this script then you can rest
assured that the CodeKlavier will run with your midi setup.
